# String Calculator TDD Kata for Incubyte

## 👋 Hello Evaluators!!

Welcome to my submission for the Incubyte's **String Calculator TDD Kata**.

While most **Code to finish, I Craft to Impress.** <br>
I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to demonstrate my commitment to **writing clean, testable code.** Not just the code that works, but code that communicates.
This project reflects my understanding of **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, my love for structure, and my belief that good software is an outcome of both thinking and discipline.

Thank you for reviewing my work — I hope it’s as enjoyable to read as it was to build.

## ✅ Features Implemented So Far

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Returns 0 for empty string | ✅ | Base case |
| Returns number for single input | ✅ | Handled non-comma strings |
| Returns sum of two numbers | ✅ | Initially handled fixed digits → Refactored using `split`, `map`, `reduce` |

## 🔁 TDD Commits explained

All changes have been committed step-by-step to show the **Fail → Pass → Refactor** cycle.

Examples:
- Add failing test for empty string input
- Make test pass for input string with single number
- Refactor: Use split/map/reduce to generalize number parsing
